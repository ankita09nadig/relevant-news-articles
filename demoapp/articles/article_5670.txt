Kaneria refutes claims he asked BCCI for help
 Former Pakistani cricketer Danish Kaneria, who was banned for spot-fixing in 2013, has dismissed reports that said he had asked the BCCI to help him return to international cricket by helping revoke his ban. Kaneria said that his words had been misinterpreted in the earlier reports. He also said he was innocent, and that he would appeal the ban again.
