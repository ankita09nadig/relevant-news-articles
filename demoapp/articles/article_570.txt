Women protest across nation to highlight women's rights
 Several women groups across India staged protest rallies on Saturday to highlight women's rights following the recent mass molestation in Bengaluru on the New Year's Eve and the subsequent comments blaming women for such incidents. Notably, the protests coincided with the "Women's March" in Washington, which was staged against US President Donald Trump over his attitude toward women, reports said.
