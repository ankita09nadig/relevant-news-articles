France striker Griezmann wins Golden Boot
 France's Antoine Griezmann won the Golden Boot at EURO 2016 after scoring six goals in the tournament. Griezmann's tally is the second highest at a single EURO, behind Michel Platini's nine in France's title-winning 1984 campaign. "It's cruel and magnificent at the same time", Griezmann said, adding, "Maybe later I can feel proud, but for now it's about the group".
