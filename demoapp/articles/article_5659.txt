Motorised glass roof for this Republic Day 
 To protect the Chief guest and other dignitaries from rain and cold during this year's Republic Day celebrations, the government has decided to set up a motorised glass roof at the VVIP enclosure. This is also to prevent a repeat as it rained during last year's Republic day which made President Obama, wife Michelle and other guests use umbrellas. \n\n\n
